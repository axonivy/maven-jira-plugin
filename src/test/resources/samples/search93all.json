Therefore important properties like the URI, usernames, passwords should be made scriptable/configurable via variables.yaml. \n\nExample: alfresco REST/OpenAPI connector with dynamic URI parts.\n\n*Remarks*:\n\n* we could re-use the JSP macro expression from soap -> \n{code:java}<%=ivy.var.myVoolUser%>{code}\n* but we already have a standard JAX-RS templating mechanism in the URI: \n{code:java}http://host:{myPort}/api{code}\n* so we may better re-use JAX-RS templating stuff in URIs and Property values\n* maybe no new concept is required: as we can already inject path properties: with 'PATH.' prefixed properties -> \n{code:java}PATH.myPort = 1234{code}\n* think of a generic concepts that works on all RDM? E.g. databases too?\n\n\n\n*Concept:*\n\n* implement config resolver to expand ivy.var values for all our configs (rest,webservice, db): \n** we already have a similar concept in .yaml files for password â there we provide $\\{decrpyt: fdfasd} as generic resolver for the config stack \n** maybe the AppConfigSource stack should only have this resolver: so that we do not see strange effect in ivy.yaml â¦ where this resolver makes no sense\n** it should be required to do bpm.exec adjustments therefore neither for REST, SOAP nor DBS.\n* do not expand resolve the values while editing the RDMs, do not yet provide any editing support for it. However, try to make the content of $\\{} expression compatible with a basic ivyScript â¦ so that users can write ivy.var.XYZ using an ivyScript editor and paste it onto an RDM property expression.\n* existing dynamic configs:\n** try to get rid of macro expressions in SOAP RDM: convert or deprecate if feasible\n*** however: the new expressions should only solve \\{ivy.var} expansions. And not be an accessor to the whole ivy.XYZ APIs.\n** keep REST http:\\{myHost}/api + PATH.myHost-property concept for itâs nice UI integration\n** make ivy.engine.baseUrl resolvable in REST and SOAP alike.\n** transform \\{ivy.engine.baseUrl} which was introduce a few weeks ago into the the new $\\{ivy.engine.baseUrl} format\n* provide cockpit support: do not expand value by default â¦ setup metadata so that the cockpit knows about these special values.

This artifact is provided by maven repository maven.axonivy.com.\r\n\r\nAll dependent projects of the connector will have this dependency on their classpath (Maven Dependencies). For ivy projects this is not necessary and counter productive as the same library gets put on the runtime classpath multiple times. But that is another problem.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-08-19-09-49-58-012.png!\r\n\r\nHowever, depending on timing the it can be that the demo project is trying to resolve the dependency first. Then the dependency cannot be resolve because the repository setting in the connector is not considered when resolving the dependency from demo project.\r\n\r\nIf the dependency is first resolved for the connector project it works.
